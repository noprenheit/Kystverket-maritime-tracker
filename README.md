# Kystverket Maritime Tracker

This project analyzes and visualizes maritime traffic data from the **Kystverket Open Data Source**. The dataset used in this project represents **Norwegian maritime traffic from January 2022**. The goal is to provide insights into ship routes, port coordinates, and traffic patterns using data analysis and visualization tools.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - The raw maritime traffic data (`seilas.csv`) was obtained from the Kystverket Open Data Source.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The dataset was cleaned and structured using Python, specifically leveraging **Pandas** and **NumPy** to handle inconsistencies and missing values. 
   - The cleaned dataset was saved as `seilas_cleaned.csv`.

3. **Port Coordinate Mapping**:
   - Port names extracted.
   - Port coordinates were retrieved using the [OpenCage Geocoder API](https://opencagedata.com/). 
   - The results were stored in `port_coordinates.csv`.

5. **Ship Route Analysis**:
   - Ship movements were analyzed, and routes were generated by combining data on port coordinates and maritime traffic. 
   - The enriched routes, including coordinates, were stored in `ship_routes_with_coords.csv`.

6. **Data Visualization**:
   - An interactive dashboard was created using **Dash** and **Plotly**, enabling users to explore ship routes, port coordinates, and traffic patterns visually.

- `seilas.csv`: Raw maritime traffic data.
- `cleaning_data.py`: Python script to clean and preprocess raw data.
- `seilas_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned version of the raw dataset.

- `unique_ports.txt`: Extracted list of unique ports in the dataset.
- `finding_port_coordinates.py`: Script to extract port coordinates using Geocoder API.

- `map_port_coordinates.py`: Script for generating visual maps of port locations.
- `port_coordinates.csv`: Dataset containing port coordinate information.

- `dashboard.py`: Streamlit dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Streamlit**: To deploy the app.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Plotly**: Visualization.
- **Dash**: Framework for building the interactive dashboard.
- **OpenCage Geocoder API**: For retrieving port coordinates.
